<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<h3>Graham Cracker Crust</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups (200g) graham cracker crumbs</li>
    <li> cup (67g) packed light or dark brown sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 cup (8 Tablespoons; 115g) unsalted butter, melted</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cheesecake Filling</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 and 1/4 cups (300ml) heavy cream or heavy whipping cream</li>
    <li>three 8-ounce blocks (680g) full-fat cream cheese, softened to room temperature</li>
    <li>1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar</li>
    <li>2 Tablespoons (15g) confectioners’ sugar</li>
    <li>1/4 cup (60g) sour cream, at room temperature</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons lemon juice</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
</ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Make the crust: Stir the graham cracker crust ingredients together.Put in a pan, pack tightly and freeze 40 10 to 20 minutes while you prepare the filling</li>
    <li>ake the filling: Using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip the cold heavy cream into stiff peaks on medium-high speed, about 4-5 minutes. Set aside.</li>
    <li>beat the cream cheese and granulated sugar together on medium speed until perfectly smooth and creamy
        add confectioners sugar, sour cream, lemon juice and vanilla and beat untill smooth</li>
     <li>Using your mixer on low speed or a rubber spatula, 
         fold the whipped cream into the cheesecake filling until combined. 
         This takes several turns of your rubber spatula. Combine slowly as you don’t want to deflate all the air in the whipped cream.</li>
    <li>Remove crust from the freezer and spread filling into crust. Use an offset spatula to smooth down the top.</li>
    <li>Cover tightly with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and refrigerate for at least 6-8 hours and up to 2 days.</li>
    <li> The last step, as always is serve and enjoy!</li>
